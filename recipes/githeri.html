        <h2><em>NOTES:</em></h2>
        <p>To reduce the cooking time, boil the beans and maize beforehand. Can store them in the freezer.
As mentioned above you can add your choice of vegetables.
Add meat or fish of your choice.</p>
<P These days its common for busy people to use ready made curry powder. 
I've not added any chillis in the dish. However, if you prefer you can add either fresh green chillis or red chilli powder.
If you don't find white corn or maize, you can use sweet corn. However, the taste will be a bit different.
To save time pressure cook the beans and maize.
I sometimes used canned githeri to save time.</p>
