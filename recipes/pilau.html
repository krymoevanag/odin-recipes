        <strong><i>This is how we do it;</i></strong>
        <li>Wash your rice and set it aside to dry. Meanwhile, in a large pan, cook your beef till golden brown. Once ready, add in your onions and oil, fry & season with salt.</li>
        <li>Add in your ginger and crushed garlic. Let it cook for a while before adding in your black pepper, cumin, cloves, and tropical heat pilau masala.</li>
        <li>Once your spices are cooked through, add in your washed rice, broth, and/or water. We did one cup of rice to two cups of broth but this is dependent on the rice you are cooking.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil once most of the broth has simmered. Serve with kachumbari and enjoy!</li>
        <p></p>
    </ol><p>pilau is sweet when served <em>hot</em>. A side plate of avocado wont hurt.</p>
